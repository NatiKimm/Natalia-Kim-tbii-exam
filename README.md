RuGer - Personalized Language Learning App

**Features**

Customized Learning Experience: Choose the languages you want to practice, your proficiency level, and topics of interest for learning.

Word Translation: Enter words in the language you're learning and receive instant translations.

Example Sentences: See how words are used in context with example sentences tailored to your chosen topic.

Word History: Save translated words to track your progress and review them later.

**Getting Started**

**Installation:**

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run the App: Navigate to the project directory. Inser the DeepL and ChatGPT keys in line 15 and 16. Run the app.py file using Python: python app.py.

**Usage:**

On the first page you have to select your target and native languages, proficiency level, and topic of interest. Make sure to make a selection in every dropdown menu (target language, level, native language, topic) to make the code work (it looks like as though options are already selected on startup - this however is not the case). On the second page enter words in the language you're learning and click "Translate me" to see translations. Click "Example" to see example sentences related to your chosen topic. Save translated words by clicking "Save me" for later review. Click "Word List" if you want to see all the words you've learned during your current session.
